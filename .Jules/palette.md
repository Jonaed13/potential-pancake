## 2024-03-24 - [Micro-UX Improvements to TUI Config]
**Learning:** TUI configuration interfaces often lack visual affordances found in GUI settings menus. Users need immediate feedback on what actions are available and the boundaries of valid inputs. Adding explicit bounds checking (clamping) and visual indicators for boolean states (ON/OFF vs True/False) significantly improves confidence.
**Action:** When designing TUI configuration screens, always include:
1. Visible key hints (e.g., "[←/→] Adjust").
2. Explicit visual states for toggles (Color-coded ON/OFF).
3. "Invisible" safety rails (clamping values) to prevent invalid configurations.

## 2024-03-25 - [Contextual Help in TUI Menus]
**Learning:** The TUI framework being used (Bubble Tea) combined with manual string concatenation for rendering (as seen in `Render` methods) makes layout management tricky. However, adding a struct-based configuration approach (`ConfigItem`) proved to be a reusable pattern for managing lists of items with associated metadata (like descriptions) in TUI menus, avoiding "magic number" indexing issues.
**Action:** Future TUI menu components should use a struct-based slice pattern (Label, Description, Value Accessor/Mutator) rather than parallel arrays or hardcoded indices.
