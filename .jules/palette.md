## 2024-05-23 - Keyboard Shortcuts Help Modal
**Learning:** In terminal applications (TUIs), discoverability of keyboard shortcuts is a major usability hurdle. Users often don't know what keys are available. Adding a global help modal (`?`) is a standard pattern that significantly improves the user experience without cluttering the main interface. It's a "pull" mechanism for help, rather than "push".
**Action:** Always verify if a TUI application has a help screen. If not, adding one is a high-value, low-effort win. Ensure it can be easily toggled on/off with the same key.
