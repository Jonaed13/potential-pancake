**Learning:** In Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs), powerful features are often hidden behind invisible keybindings. Users in "Command Center" modes expect density but fail to discover basic controls without explicit hints.
**Action:** Always provide a "Help" overlay accessible via `?` or `F1`, and ensure a persistent "Help" hint exists in the footer, even in minimal modes.
